# My Very Goofy Website :]

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository for my website! I created this website purely for fun and to showcase my skills as a web developer. I put a lot of effort into designing and building this site, and I'm excited to share it with you.

My website features a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the site from scratch, and I also incorporated some third-party libraries and plugins to enhance its functionality.
